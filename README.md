Collaboration
Collaboration amongst students is allowed to the extent outlined in the syllabus. That being the case, the goal of these
assignments is not to share code, but to learn the tools you need to succeed as a computer scientist. Students are expected to
write their own code free of plagiarism from any other student past or current. All assignments will be cross referenced across
all sections of CS135 using the Measure Of Software Similarity (Moss) to automatically determine the similarity of programs.
Refer to the syllabus for further details and consequences of breaking this policy.
